This folder contains the implementation of our proposed modelling procedure for Google cost-per-click prediction (CPC) together with a small anonymized subsample of the data used in our study. The demo notebook is intended as a transparent walkthrough showing how each individual module works. The code can also be run as a whole from terminal by calling main.py.
