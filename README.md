# "Cracking Google's Ad Rank Algorithm: A Deep Learning Approach To Cost-Per-Click Prediction"

## Stage 1: Timeseries Forecasting Algorithm (Goal 3 Months June - August 2022)
Test different models from univariate statistical to complex deep learning to predict advertiser CPC on multiple horizons.

**Time horizons:**
 - [ ] Quarter (start here)
 - [ ] Month
 - [ ] Week

**Models to test:**
 - [ ] ARIMA
 - [ ] LSTM
 - [ ] RNN
 - [ ] TFT
 - [ ] ...


## Stage 2: Graph Neural Network Predictor (Goal 3 Months September - November 2022)
Generate GNN network of advertisers bidding on the same search keywords to use as predictor and interpreter for the above model.

*Which businesses are connected through bids on similar keywords?*

*How does this competition affect CPCs?; Who is most profitable?*
